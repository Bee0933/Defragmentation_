# Defragmentation_
#A virtual Defragmentation Algorithm from the concept of file retrieval on a Hard Drive. Practiced with the use of objects and “char” data type in c++ .

- The Nodes act as "sectors".
The Node objects holds the "char" data, which is passed to a contiguous memory location. Storage size is dynamic and new nodes can be created.
The "recover_virtual_defragment" function only prints the data as in a contiguous location format, but does not return values (can be modified to return values with the return keyword)
